# Kafuu Chino's Minecraft Bedrock Edition Realms Addon
I do not work at or with Microsoft or Mojang nor do I claim to own any code by them. This is just a little personal mod project I made for myself and my friends. Feel free to use any of my changes to the code in your own little projects for whatever reason. I do not care.

What this addon does (so far):
  1. Adds a new item apple 2. A better apple that can be used as a snack or mining tool.
  2. Added apple 2 to the cow loot table with a 0-1 chance of dropping.
  3. Made cows angry and attack the player if they see you holding a apple 2.

So far that's all that has been done. I am still learning and plan to do more.
Like:
  1. Change the texture of apple 2 to a unique texture.
  2. Add more stuff that the apple 2 can do.
  3. Add more tools as apple 2 is really just a place holder as I learn.
  4. And even more stuff!

My plans with this project is in the end to add QoL features/unique stuff to my realm with my friends for free!
